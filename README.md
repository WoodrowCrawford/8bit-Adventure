# 8bit-Adventure

## What this is
This is a mini tech demo I came up with to learn how to use unity 2D. Things like 2D animation, tilemaps, and a dialogue system is present.


## How to play
Use the WASD keys to move

Press the E key to interact with the circle

Click on the response you want to say and the circle will respond to it

Press the tab key to Speed up the text dialogue

Press down on the arrow keys by a door to teleport

### Note: As this is just a tech demo, there are still a few bugs present.
